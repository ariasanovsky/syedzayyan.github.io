description = "You know well plates? I have seen people printing layouts of them and the scribbling concentration values on them? Is that intuitive? Not at all. Is that a waste of paper? Yes. And then on top of that if you were to make a presentation of the well plates for example teaching students how the colors magically change when you add trypsin to a protein. I was there once. Hence this tool(?). It lets you do all of that."
